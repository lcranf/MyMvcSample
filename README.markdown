MyMvcSample is intended as a blueprint for using ASP.NET MVC3 with an Ioc (in this case Ninject) with EF Code First and MvcScaffolding.  The project will eventually include several T4Scaffolding templates which will generate files for CRUD'ing operations.  This project also makes use of Ninject Conventions to allow services to be auto-discovered that reside in assemblies within the App Domain.  The overall design starts with service classes which are responsible for the nuances surrounding CRUD'ing an Entity.  An example service interface and corresponding class is below for an Order entity:


public interface IOrderService : ICrudService<Order>
{
    //add custom methods for Order here...
}


public class OrderService : CrudService<Order>, IOrderService
{
    public OrderService(IRepository<Order> repository)
     : base(repository)
    {
    }
}


**Note:** The above classes will be auto generated by the supplied T4Scaffolding templates (coming soon...)


Be aware that in this architecture all entities must inherit from `IEnity`.  The sample also using the EF Hooks project to manage standard audit fields (CreatedOn, CreatedBy, etc...) automatically
